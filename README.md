# 1.20.1-legacy
This branch was the original 1.20.1 version.

Due to poorly planned refactors, it diverged irreparably from
the branch now known as `1.20.1`.

The other branch was chosen to be the main one since it seems to
be what more mods are using.

[Tamago](https://modrinth.com/mod/tamago) is a compat mod that will
do its best to automatically patch mods using the legacy branch to
work on the new one.
If you do not want to deal with the effort of porting to the new
branch, this should work. Either include it with your mod or tell
people to install it.

This situation is quite a mess and has gone unresolved far too long
due to time constraints, so now we need to do breaking changes
extremely late into a version's lifecycle. I'm sorry to anyone this
disrupts, and I will make sure this doesn't happen again.
